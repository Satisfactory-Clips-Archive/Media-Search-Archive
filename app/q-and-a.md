>
> um so we we want it we want it so that
>
> it's easy for everyone to access um and

> we also don't want to encourage this
>
> kind of like
>
> fragmentation in the modern community
>
> where if we have
>

>
> create for workshop
>

>
> they don't get mods just because the
>
> modders don't want to make mods for

>
> kind of weird uh and then if modders
>
> want to support workshop and everyone
>
> else then they have to like
>
> take care of these two platform things

> so there's a couple things to think
>
> about there um

>
> we're doing yet there yet but
>
> um there's gonna be i think there's
>
> definitely gonna be some
>
> solution for people to install it
>
> regardless of where they are

> don't use workshop
>

> a reality
>
> a possibility but we'll see when we get
>
> closer and we'd also
>
> work with the current modding community
>
> to figure out what works best for them
>
> as well because
>
> there's there's a like there's different
>
> parties here right there's both like the
>
> people that want to install mods
>
> there's our from our aspect how we want
>
> to handle it and then the modern
>
> community
>
> because we want to we don't want to like
>
>  on the modern community and be like
>
> yeah they spend so much time working on
>
> the mods right now and then be like
>
> all right now you have to change
>
> completely how you upload mods
>
> like we don't want to do that we want to
>
> work together with them
>
> yeah exactly and it's like
>
> uh you know i know like workshop
>
> workshop is pretty
>
> easy to use but even if you look at the
>
> modding community there are a few
>
> unofficial modding communities
>
> tools and repository and everything it's
>
> insanely easy to use
>
> yeah it's just an app you just launch

> you want to make a thing so you can do
>
> it um are there any green
>
> energy options in the game relative uh
>
> news of the game but cold feels bad
>
> uh so the thing with green energy is
>
> something we've thought about and
>
> something that we sort of toss up and oh
>
> i'm not sure what we want to do but i
>
> think we lean to not doing it but the
>
> option is still there
>
> and the reason the reason for doing it
>
> is because it i don't know it's kind of
>
> fun
>
> right but the reason to not do it is the
>
> point of the game
>
> is you work for a company that doesn't
>
> give a about the planet
>
> and your whole goal is to just exploit
>
> the planet
>
> at any cost spew carbon up into the air
>
> don't care destroy everything cut down
>
> every tree
>
> kill every creature mine up all the
>
> resources
>
> yeah um so that is the point of the game
>
> that is the story and lore so in order
>
> you know if you're gonna invest in green
>
> energy it
>
> lore wise it doesn't make much sense but
>
> if you balance that with
>
> fun then maybe it does make sense or
>
> maybe
>
> it will be a mod like i mean
>
> you know video games is escapism right
>
> like
>
> we we give you this option like you can
>
> go and and be as dirty as you want you

### [Q&A: Confused on the use of Controllers?](https://archive.satisfactory.video/transcriptions/yt-BuC0nQS2Kqs) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuC0nQS2Kqs

<details>

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> um stuff like that
>
> um confused on the use of controllers
>
> you said that they're not supported but
>
> i've been using one since they
>
> uh since early access launch should i
>
> expect my use of controller to change
>
> uh so it's really weird that that's the
>
> case because we've um pretty sure we
>
> spent
>
> literally no time on making that work
>
> uh we well we did way back when and then
>
> just stop supporting it completely
>
> the fact that it works i think is a mere
>
> coincidence as for whether it will
>
> change in the future i think mappings
>
> and things like that might change
>
> who knows since it seems to be working
>
> by magic anyway uh but
>
> um yeah unless i don't think we're gonna
>
> remove it like i don't think we're gonna
>
> be like
>
> delete the support um you know actively
>
> go and do that
>
> so hopefully it will just keep working
>
> for you hopefully
>
> we did talk a while back with steam
>
> controllers
>
> that they were like we had our initial
>
> like controller
>
> setup that we've we kind of like quite
>
> quite abandoned
>
> when we were working on because it was
>
> so hard to maintain it um
>
> but there has been control support like
>
> at some point during development
>
> and then yep it was too much yeah like
>
> you just said uh
>
> and then when we were launched on steam
>
> there was some issue with like steam
>
> controllers
>
> not like you could because you can like
>
> remap
>
> uh on steam in some manner i'm not quite
>
> sure how it works
>
> yeah yeah you can um and i remember
>
> there was some discussion that like if
>
> we remove
>
> the current controller support then it
>
> would be easier to do that remapping or
>
> something but maybe we didn't need to
>
> or something i don't quite remember but
>
> if it works then cool uh
>
> yeah i don't know i don't know how it
>
> works i don't know why yeah i also don't
>
> like because like some things i don't
>
> know if you can do on controller
>
> like you can't do mass dismantle i think
>
> a controller and stuff like that so
>
> [Music]

> yeah yeah

> does it always see on spotify
>
> no not yet the one of the main reasons
>
> why we haven't released the osd on
>
> spotify is because there are still
>
> there's still
>
> stuff coming um there's still more music
>
> to be
>
> heard in the game and such um

> and i guess there's been like maybe some

>
> uh we were i was in a meeting

> spotify or whatever streaming services
>
> that you guys wanted on or
>
> whatever i don't fully know who who
>
> has rights and what not to the music
>
