> add planes as vehicles that make you
>
> automated to
>
> carry resources i don't think so
>
> uh or like drones or something similar
>
> uh i
>
> don't know i don't think so um
>
> personally because it's a
>
> it's a pretty complex
>
> thing i've talked a lot with uh some of
>
> the developers on factorio about how
>
> they do drones
>
> um and they're really expensive
>
> in terms of performance and
>
> you know it's it's something that if we
>
> want to implement that we have to you
>
> know
>
> take that into consideration um and
>
> there's so much else
>
> right now that's so expensive in the
>
> game so maybe if we can make room for it
>
> in the uh
>
> in the performance budget um then
>
> we might be able to do it but then
>
> there's also the aspect of like it needs
>
> to
>
> look good in 3d as well and stuff like
>
> that and how would that work and blah
>
> blah
>
> and not like clip and a lot more so
>
> than it's already doing
>
> so so like it's not impossible but i
>
> personally think it's kind of
>
> like maybe not happening we'll see
>
> drop if you want to see it happen
>
> remember to
>
> plop it over on the question site i'll
>
> drop a link on it on the
>
> uh on the steam chat as well so if you
>
> have any suggestions make sure to shop
>
> drop in on our on our questions site
>
> to make it happen
>
> but but yeah like there are probably
>
> ways we could implement like we could
>
> maybe do like a similar
>
> situation with like you know the drone
>
> to make like
>
> like you can't build on top of it right
>
> so it would just shoot it straight up
>
> and then maybe we'll come down somewhere
>
> else and drop off the the the resources
>
> and stuff like that
>
> like it's not impossible to do some kind
>
> of drone i would say
>
> um but but
>
> we also don't know like would that be
>
> cool enough i don't know it would be it
>
> would be much cooler if you could like
>
> have a drone move around
>
> and like pick up a container or
>
> something you know and like you could
>
> fly with it or something i don't know it
>
> would that would be
>
>  amazing but that feels expensive
>
> as
>
> i also wouldn't like the game
>
> really wouldn't work great with flying

> their internal discussions to

> significantly rework existing buildings

>
> so this is this is tricky because
>
> we can't first of all yes we're always
>
> talking like we're always
>
> uh measuring like perform like balancing
>
> is the word i was looking for
>
> um we're always looking into like what
>
> we can improve
>
> uh and i believe like early game we are
>
> kind of like
>
> up until coal i feel like we're pretty
>
> happy with everything so i don't think
>
> that will ever change
>
> um that's a guess on my end i'm not sure
>
> if that's actually the case
>
> but yeah the the late game and like mid
>
> game
>
> stuff that will like probably change a
>
> bit
>
> in the future but the thing is like if
>
> we do any like
>
> major change then people say files break
>
> and that's something also we we're not
>
> like we we won't
>
> we have to like make a good um
>
> what am i what am i looking for like we
>
> don't want to
>
> change those unless we really need to
>
> because it really messes up the safe but
>
> for a lot of people
>
> and yeah that's pretty much it like
>
> there are always ideas on how we can
>
> improve things
>
> so yeah
>
> but yeah we don't exactly we don't want
>
> to hold back because of that
>
> so like if we feel like yeah it's worth
>
> it then we'll do it and that was the
>
> case like with pipes
>
> we've also done that before in the past
>
> with how steel production works
>
> we changed like the recipes for steel
>
> which also broke all stitch
>
> steel
>
> [Music]
>
> progress in the game and that was also
>
> something like okay
>
> but this will actually benefit in the
>
> long run
>
> so um but it's like it's it's tricky
>
> because a lot of people do get
>
> pretty upset when we do that um
>
> so it's it's give and take you know
>
> bigger pipe flow rates are
>
> uh i don't know the specifics but there
>
> is some
>
> update on on on that stuff um
>
> i ca i'm trying to remember like i think
>
> there is
>
> plans for like mark ii pipes or there
>
> are plans to like change
>
> flow rates or something there like there
>
> are
>
> things coming y'all uh for that stuff
>
> i'm pretty sure it's mark two pipes or
>
> something
>
> don't know if they'll make it for uh
>
> update four uh or update five or
>
> whatever
>
> but yeah we are gonna update we're gonna
>

> blueprints would be awesome for late

>
> some better solution for endgame um
>

>
> the the the debate is like that's part

>
> it's understandable the feeling that

> you know end game is a hassle and

> we've blueprints are are technically

>
> uh not specifically tied into blueprints
>
> per se but like things that can really

>
> building stuff you know like one really
>

>
> a
>
> like just implementing that quality of

> add a ton um there are there have been
>

>

>
> feature
>
> completely changes like you know how how
>
> you build stuff like i remember before
>
> we had the mass dismantle feature
>
> like just adding being able to like mass
>
> dismantle stuff really improve the game
>

>
> you know maybe go for a full-on

>
> performance wise in the game especially

> first person like when you're running

>
> uh you cannot send like every single
>
> tick like this is what i'm doing
>
> like on client you have to do prediction

> then try to predict what's going on and
>
> that's one thing on player characters
>
> because they're capsules but on vehicles
>
> is much more complex
>
> because you also have like physics

>

### Transcript

> mass foundation creation um
>
> mark talked about this a while ago like
>
> before holiday vacation
>
> um where we
>
> oh maybe this was a video that jace put
>
> out but we talked about
>
> essentially that we are kind of
>
> considering you know doing some kind of
>
> um not blueprints but like
>
> some kind of similar system or or
>
> something that makes sense in our game
>
> we don't think that blueprints
>
> by like the way the blueprints are like
>
> implemented in other games like factorio
>
> we don't think that makes sense in our
>
> game but we are looking into
>
> you know some kind of similar system to
>
> that
>
> to make late game building more
>
> enjoyable
>
> as you as you may know we're still done
>
> not done with the game there's still a
>
> lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of
>
> people
>
> you know think it's tedious when you
>
> reach the end game to not be able to
>
> like
>
> you know mass build and stuff like that
>
> and we we take that into
>
> consideration uh part of the game part
>
> of what makes this game fun too
>
> is like there's two problems math mass
>
> building
>
> uh there's one where the object
>
> constraint limit with the engine
>
> that makes if if we enable more people
>
> to build bigger things then they're
>
> gonna run into
>
> that wall much quicker that's one
>
> problem the other problem is that
>
> um a lot of aspects as to what makes the
>
> game fun
>
> is the fact that you are you know this
>
> pioneer
>
> and you're hand selecting stuff and
>
> building stuff
>
> building up this everything by yourself
>
> and like these huge
>
> huge bases are really achievements from
>
> our players
>
> doing all that stuff and uh it's it's
>
> scary to remove
>
> that aspect of the game because that can
>
> really like optimize out the fun another
>
> game
>
> but we know that it's pretty tedious for
>
> a lot of people to do that stuff so we
>
> are
>
> looking into ways to improve it but i
>
> don't know
>
> right now what our intentions are um
>
> but when we hear you like it's it's not
>
> a it's not like a
>
> yeah we hear you guys
>
> uh and i can't mention i can mention
>
> somebody mentioned like the
>
> the mods that exist we have looked at
>
> the mods and we don't really like the
>
> solution
>
> um that mods have made
>
> um because we feel like like i said
>
> before it really optimized like the mods
>
> the way they are built right now they
>
> optimize out the fun out of the game for
>
> us
>
> um the way we perceive it and also like
>
> i know a lot of people gonna be like no
>
> but a lot of people download the mods
>
> but
>
> our core game player base do not
>
> download those mods um
>
> so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but
>
> uh
>
> yeah it's it's like there's always that
>
> case when you know we have our opinions
>
> of what we don't want to do with the
>
> game and what we think are best for the
>
> game
>
> and then you know you guys definitely
>
> have good suggestions too it's not that
>
> we're saying like
>
> our no our mega brains are we're much
>
> since like our mega brains have the
>
> right answers
>
> and like this is how a game is supposed
>
> to be uh
>
> every design decision affects a lot of
>
> the game
>
> and uh it's it's um
>
> it's really tricky it's really tricky so
>
> that's why we're a bit hesitant to just
>
> like throw in
>
> you know multi build modes and stuff
>
> like that
>
> so yeah

> call it that because uh
>
> i mean you won't necessarily see a big
>
> difference we'll see a big difference
>
> probably
>
> um but there are also some minor things
>
> that we feel like we want to probably
>
> release before update four because we
>
> really don't know the scope of update 4
>
> yet
>
> like if it's going to be a big update or
>
> a small update or
>
> like um because it also ties a bit in
>
> with like what are we doing for update 5
>
> because we also had we had a plan for
>
> update 5 for a long time
>
> which is kind of weird to say when we
>
> don't know what update 4 is but we do
>
> know what update 5
>
> is um
>
> but uh yeah we're
>
> we had a plan for update 5 and we kind
>
> of had to scrap that because
>
> of like how it was it was
>
> it was tied into like dependencies
>
> between like programmers and artists
>
> so when we were planning for update 5 we
>
> were expecting like okay but
>
> update 5 is going to be where both
>
> programmers and artists can
>
> kind of like combine forces and do a lot
>
> of work together so update four would be
>
> like more of a
>
> not a lot of like tasking for
>
> programmers because programmers wanted
>
> to work on
>
> like we we have a lot of technical depth
>
> in the in the game right now
>
> so like we need to update a bunch of
>
> systems we want to update engine
>
> um there was just a bunch of stuff like
>
> that
>
> and uh we realized that uh
>
> we can't do that we can't wait for for
>
> programming like that
>
> so so we had we had ideas on what to do
>
> with update five
>
> but we can't do that right now so but
>
> yeah
>
> this is all very vague because there are
>
> nothing set in stone yet um but
>
> i think i think like fairly soon we can
>
> start like
>
> hammering down on what update 4 is
>
> actually going to be like we're also
>
> kind of like working out how we're going
>
> to
>
> go forward this because update 3 was
>
> like you know very hush hush
>
> and we want it to be a bit more open
>
> develop like more of an open development
>
> process going forward um
>
> so we're also kind of like figuring out
>
> how we do that
>
> and if you guys have anything specific
>
> that you like that you like to see from
>
> other developers
>
> um please hit us up with like you know
>
> other things that you like i know that
>
> arc for instance does
>
> do their uh development in a certain way
>
> and like factorio is also a good

> inspiration for like their friday facts
>
> stuff
>
> and stuff like that so we're also
>
> looking a lot like that what you guys
>
> want to see and you know

> what is the limit it's kind of hard to
>
> say what the limit is because
>
> uh a lot of people confuse the limit
>
> with like object limits like
>
> in-game object limits which is not what
>
> is it what
>
> that is it's tied into the data
>
> objects data objects which isn't like
>
> one constructor are more data objects
>
> than a foundation for instance
>
> yes and no that's it's the primitive
>
> stuff too
>
> so we're trying to so it's pretty much
>
> i mean it's technically possible to say
>
> exactly what the limit is
>
> but it it really depends how you build
>
> because i've loaded
>
> save files that have that are
>
> less complex than all than say false
>
> that have hit the limit so to speak
>
> uh and it's mostly things that we are
>
> need to optimize for
>
> um because there are cases sometimes
>
> where like we just didn't think of like
>
> oh this is using a lot of stuff
>
> yeah we i think with the train update we
>
> had one issue where there's
>
> it was a simple thing of uh particle
>
> systems weren't being destroyed
>
> yeah so every time it took a turn it was
>
> scraping and that was just a miss
>
> like and i think it was just in
>
> blueprint even so it wasn't even yeah so
>
> yeah you find those things out too late
>
> after people with like big saves
>
> have trains running everywhere and then
>
> you're like why are they hitting the
>
> limit they shouldn't be hitting the
>
> limit
>
> then you could even see it as like
>
> people were playing it the game would
>
> slow down oh
>
> the fps was like chugging you're like
>
> why is this happening yeah take like 20
>
> minutes then the game was at a
>
> standstill
>
> there's also cases where uh if you like
>
> looked at a lot of or if you open a lot
>
> of storage containers you would also hit

### Transcript

> what's happening why do big updates at
>
> all when it just releases everything in
>
> small bites
>
> so one so it's kind of like
>
> unfortunately two ways here
>
> because um there's also the aspect that
>
> we need to put out our game and we also
>
> need to
>
> think about you know it it sounds shitty
>
> but it's
>
> you know it's part of the industry we
>
> also have to think about how do we keep
>
> con like continuing the sales of
>
> satisfactory
>
> um we we also try to
>
> figure out like okay we have a big
>
> player base and we really we want to
>
> nurture that player base but we also
>
> want to keep drawing in new players
>
> so having bigger updates is is the best
>
> way really to to draw in new players to
>
> the game like having a big
>
> you know release of updates um
>
> really draws in new players and
>
> unfortunately also keeping you know that
>
> kind of updates like secret and
>
> making a big splash once it's revealed
>
> also draws in a lot more players
>
> but it also kind of alienates you know
>
> the current ones
>
> uh during the process of making that
>
> update so it there's a really difficult
>
> like decision there on what the correct
>
> balance is
>
> for that and that's mainly the reason
>
> why we're not telling you guys you know
>
> everything right now you
>
> we could tell you like everything that's
>
> coming you know in in 1.0 or like what
>
> we
>
> think are gonna come you know uh but the
>
> problem with that is also we build
>
> expectations that may we may not deliver
>
> just because of you know various reasons
>
> um either because like we didn't feel
>
> like we could
>
> um and we don't want to make pro
>
> promises like we don't want to say that
>
> you know like
>
> there's going to be unlimited resources
>
> in the game in the sense that like you
>
> can build how far like there are always
>
> going to be limitations to the game
>
> there's also going to be limitations of
>
> how far we can go into each mechanic and
>
> stuff like that
>
> the few things that we know for sure are
>
> stuff like we are going to have signs
>
> we know that we're gonna have a better
>
> train system like
>
> the signaling we're gonna have some form
>
> of like signaling system
>
> or collision or you know something like
>
> that four trains
>
> in the game um at some point
>
> um
>
> you know there are certain things that
>
> we know for sure that we want to work on
>
> and that's the reason why there is no
>
> like direct road map
>
> uh because we well the main reason why
>
> we don't have
>
> a roadmap is because we don't want to
>
> limit ourselves to time
>
> like time stamps um
>
> like we could say this is what we think
>
> the games can contain but the the
>
> the thing that we're kind of hesitant
>
> about is that we don't want to
>
> set up like we're going to expect to
>
> release an update
>
> like every so often or whatever um
>
> because we really
>
> do want to take the time we feel like we
>
> need to be able to implement stuff
>
> and the fallacy of the roadmap is that
>
> uh
>
> it can create it creates these like
>
> situations where we feel like we need to
>
> get stuff out
>
> and that makes us crunch so like update
>
> three was unfortunately a bit of a
>
> crunch period for us which isn't
>
> how we want to work um it creates
>
> like a deadline that even though we say
>
> like we shouldn't crunch and like you
>
> know we shouldn't
>
> the problem with that is that then we
>
> need to delay and then you get like the
>
> the the
>
> the splash from that uh
>
> with it being you know it's kind of it's
>
> frustrating like we don't want to delay
>
> stuff because it's frustrating for
>
> everyone um so we'd rather you know dish
>
> out things as we know
>
> when we feel like we are capable of
>
> dishing the map

>
> unreal engine 5 operating is is going to

>

>

>

> or
>
> how what we need to do to implement it
>
> so it's it's possible
>
> um but we don't know yeah but i don't
>
> know
>
> like we will be updating on real engine
>
> we're we're kind of like
>
> you have like two type of developers
>

>
> some always update engine and there's
>

>

> as well would official mod support use
>
> steam workshop or like factory in-game
>
> mod installation allow epic games people
>
> to install them we would have to come up
>
> with some solution that
>
> uh everyone can um use the mods right
>
> and and that's uh you know we're on epic
>
> and steam now but we may be on other
>
> things in the future who knows right
>
> um so we we want it we want it so that
>
> it's easy for everyone to access um and
>
> we also don't want to encourage this
>
> kind of like
>
> fragmentation in the modern community
>
> where if we have
>
> workshop then people might only just
>
> create for workshop
>
> um and and then another chunk of the
>
> community
>
> or people who don't own any of the other
>
> platforms are
>
> they don't get mods just because the
>
> modders don't want to make mods for
>
> anything other than workshop and it gets
>
> kind of weird uh and then if modders
>
> want to support workshop and everyone
>
> else then they have to like
>
> take care of these two platform things
>
> so there's a couple things to think
>
> about there um
>
> but i it's not something that we've
>
> stopped to decide and figure out what
>
> we're doing yet there yet but
>
> um there's gonna be i think there's
>
> definitely gonna be some
>
> solution for people to install it
>
> regardless of where they are
>
> and there's even the reality where we
>
> don't use workshop
>
> and we only use that other method that's
>
> a reality
>
> a possibility but we'll see when we get
>
> closer and we'd also
>
> work with the current modding community
>
> to figure out what works best for them
>
> as well because
>
> there's there's a like there's different
>
> parties here right there's both like the
>
> people that want to install mods
>
> there's our from our aspect how we want
>
> to handle it and then the modern
>
> community
>
> because we want to we don't want to like
>
>  on the modern community and be like
>
> yeah they spend so much time working on
>
> the mods right now and then be like
>
> all right now you have to change
>
> completely how you upload mods
>
> like we don't want to do that we want to
>
> work together with them
>
> yeah exactly and it's like
>
> uh you know i know like workshop
>
> workshop is pretty
>
> easy to use but even if you look at the
>
> modding community there are a few
>
> unofficial modding communities
>
> tools and repository and everything it's
>
> insanely easy to use
>
> yeah it's just an app you just launch
>
> the game with a different application
>
> and that's it you can get any mod you

> you dev's ever seen a mod has been like
>
> oh we need to put that in the game um
>
> [Music]
>
> not really like we have there's never
>
> been a case where like we see a modern
>
> like we have to do that
>
> there's been cases where we've been
>
> thinking like this would be cool but
>
> we've never been able to like have time
>
> to test it out
>
> and then we see a mod of it and be like
>
> oh that's interesting and then we either
>
> be like
>
> we didn't like that or that's cool we
>
> should maybe consider that or
>
> like confirmation of like our ideas but
>
> rarely are there any mods where we're
>
> like
>
> oh my god we never thought of that like
>
> we've worked in this game for so long
>
> that and like we pretty much have every
>
> idea this they're very
>
> rare it's very rare any kind of like
>
> unique idea comes along
>
> yeah or at least not for maybe for me
>
> and jace or at least from from my point
>
> of view because i haven't been part of
>
> the development process the entire way
>
> through satisfactory so sometimes
>
> there's like
>
> i see something and i'm like oh this is
>
> really cool and i go to mark with it and
>
> he's like
>
> yeah we thought of that and uh it has
>
> these issues
>
> uh um
>
> like for what one example for instance
>
> is the wind turbine
>
> mod that's something that we had in the
>
> game very early on but we
>
> felt like it didn't give any like
>
> interesting decisions when you when
>
> you're installing them and stuff like
>
> that
>
> uh whereas with biofuel the internet is
>
> the interesting decision there is
>
> how the do i get rid of it right
>
> um but we are like influenced by mods a
>
> lot i i'd say
>
> at least in terms of you know seeing
>
> like what works and what doesn't work
>
> and seeing like
>
> this is an interesting way of doing it
>
> um stuff like that
>
> so doesn't see like another
>
> implementation yeah we can sort of
>
> judge like all right that's kind of cool
>
> but we might do it differently or
>
> something yeah
