> what's happening why do big updates at
>
> all when it just releases everything in
>
> small bites
>
> so one so it's kind of like
>
> unfortunately two ways here
>
> because um there's also the aspect that
>
> we need to put out our game and we also
>
> need to
>
> think about you know it it sounds shitty
>
> but it's
>
> you know it's part of the industry we
>
> also have to think about how do we keep
>
> con like continuing the sales of
>
> satisfactory
>
> um we we also try to
>
> figure out like okay we have a big
>
> player base and we really we want to
>
> nurture that player base but we also
>
> want to keep drawing in new players
>
> so having bigger updates is is the best
>
> way really to to draw in new players to
>
> the game like having a big
>
> you know release of updates um
>
> really draws in new players and
>
> unfortunately also keeping you know that
>
> kind of updates like secret and
>
> making a big splash once it's revealed
>
> also draws in a lot more players
>
> but it also kind of alienates you know
>
> the current ones
>
> uh during the process of making that
>
> update so it there's a really difficult
>
> like decision there on what the correct
>
> balance is
>
> for that and that's mainly the reason
>
> why we're not telling you guys you know
>
> everything right now you
>
> we could tell you like everything that's
>
> coming you know in in 1.0 or like what
>
> we
>
> think are gonna come you know uh but the
>
> problem with that is also we build
>
> expectations that may we may not deliver
>
> just because of you know various reasons
>
> um either because like we didn't feel
>
> like we could
>
> um and we don't want to make pro
>
> promises like we don't want to say that
>
> you know like
>
> there's going to be unlimited resources
>
> in the game in the sense that like you
>
> can build how far like there are always
>
> going to be limitations to the game
>
> there's also going to be limitations of
>
> how far we can go into each mechanic and
>
> stuff like that
>
> the few things that we know for sure are
>
> stuff like we are going to have signs
>
> we know that we're gonna have a better
>
> train system like
>
> the signaling we're gonna have some form
>
> of like signaling system
>
> or collision or you know something like
>
> that four trains
>
> in the game um at some point
>
> um
>
> you know there are certain things that
>
> we know for sure that we want to work on
>
> and that's the reason why there is no
>
> like direct road map
>
> uh because we well the main reason why
>
> we don't have
>
> a roadmap is because we don't want to
>
> limit ourselves to time
>
> like time stamps um
>
> like we could say this is what we think
>
> the games can contain but the the
>
> the thing that we're kind of hesitant
>
> about is that we don't want to
>
> set up like we're going to expect to
>
> release an update
>
> like every so often or whatever um
>
> because we really
>
> do want to take the time we feel like we
>
> need to be able to implement stuff
>
> and the fallacy of the roadmap is that
>
> uh
>
> it can create it creates these like
>
> situations where we feel like we need to
>
> get stuff out
>
> and that makes us crunch so like update
>
> three was unfortunately a bit of a
>
> crunch period for us which isn't
>
> how we want to work um it creates
>
> like a deadline that even though we say
>
> like we shouldn't crunch and like you
>
> know we shouldn't
>
> the problem with that is that then we
>
> need to delay and then you get like the
>
> the the
>
> the splash from that uh
>
> with it being you know it's kind of it's
>
> frustrating like we don't want to delay
>
> stuff because it's frustrating for
>
> everyone um so we'd rather you know dish
